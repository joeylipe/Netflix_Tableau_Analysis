## Dashboard Preview & Design Rationale



### Custom Design & Visualization Choices

* **Color Palette:** The dashboardâ€™s theme and typography utilize the official Netflix logo color palette, sourced for inspiration from [OnlinePalette.com](https://www.onlinepalette.com/netflix/).
    * **Color Usage:** **Dark Accent (#B00710)** was applied to table structures and chart axes, while **Light Accent (#E50914)** was used for primary KPIs.
* **Visual Modification:** The original **packed bubbles** chart was intentionally redesigned into a **Pie Chart** to provide a clearer, more direct visual comparison of the Movie vs. TV Show volume ratio.
